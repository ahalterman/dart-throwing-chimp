# The first step assumes you have downloaded the Excel series for the Forcibly Displaced Populations data set from
# the Center for Systemic Peace's INSCR Data Page and saved it to the working directory. The link address for that
# data set is:
# http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscr/FDP2008a.xls

# Load required packages
library(XLConnect)
library(plyr)
library(WDI)

# Read fdp data
fdp <- readWorksheetFromFile("fdp2008a.xls", sheet=1)

# This step uses ddply to sum internally displaced persons and hosted refugees for the world each year. The years
# with no observations get zeroes, so we manually replace those with NAs.
refugees <- ddply(fdp, .(year), summarise,
  idps = sum(idp, na.rm = TRUE),
  hosted = sum(host, na.rm = TRUE),
  total = idps + hosted)
# Replace false 0s with NAs
refugees$idps <- ifelse(refugees$idps == 0, NA, refugees$idps)
refugees$hosted <- ifelse(refugees$hosted == 0, NA, refugees$hosted)
refugees$total <- ifelse(refugees$total == 0, NA, refugees$total)

# This step uses the WDI package to ingest data directly from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, so
# no downloading required:
pop <- WDI(country="1W", indicator = "SP.POP.TOTL", extra = FALSE, start = 1964, end = 2008)
pop$pop <- pop$SP.POP.TOTL/1000 # Rescale to 1,000s to match refugee data
refugees <- merge(refugees, subset(pop, select = c(year, pop)), all.x = TRUE)

# Then we generate the statistics on refugess as a share of the global population
refugees$total.pct <- 100 * (refugees$total / refugees$pop)

# Then we plot the data.
